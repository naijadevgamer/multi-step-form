<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## 🌍 Overview

![screenshot](./src/app.jpg)

Welcome to my Multi-Step Form project! 🎉 This form is designed to guide users through a series of steps to complete a task. It’s perfect for scenarios where you need to collect detailed information from users in an organized manner. Whether you're building a signup form or a survey, this setup makes it smooth and engaging! 📝✨

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

### 🛠️ Built With

This application was built using the following technologies:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For type-safe JavaScript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For beautiful, responsive design
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) - For structure and layout

### What I Learned

Building this multi-step form was a fantastic learning experience! 😄 I got to dive deep into TypeScript and Tailwind CSS while handling form validation and dynamic updates. Managing state and user interactions across multiple steps was a bit tricky, but it was rewarding to see it all come together! 💪

One of the highlights was learning how to effectively handle form navigation and validations. Also, it was exciting to see how Tailwind CSS helped in creating a clean and responsive design effortlessly. 🌟

### My Wisdom 🌟

Here's a little piece of wisdom from my journey: "Keep experimenting and don’t be afraid to make mistakes. Every challenge is a chance to learn and grow." 💡
